*"Yet another emulator?"*

There is no point beating around the bush, people have written Gameboy emulators before with great success, however I've always been curious as to how they are done. This project was set up as a learning exercise to help me understand how the basic principles of how computers function at the lowest level and how you can simulate them in software.

Since then it's become my side project and I feel I'm at a point where I can share it with the world. 

# Features

* Cross platform support for 64bit Windows, Linux and OSX operating system
* Supports most\* of the traditional black and white Gameboy ROMs
* Supports most\* Gameboy Color ROMs with full color support (and black and white mode for supported GBC titles if desired)
* Battery saves facility, with compressed save files for lightweight storage
* Six screen resolutions
* Passes all of the blargg CPU instruction and instruction timing tests
* Delightful emulation of the scrolling Nintendo "boot screen" when you load the emulator up (can be disabled)
